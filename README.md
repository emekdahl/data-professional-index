# Data Professional Index

A collection of useful information I want to remember as a data professional.

I got this idea from [Maria Popova on how she uses an index to power Brain Pickings](https://tim.blog/2015/07/24/maria-popova-starting-a-successful-blog/).

The template for this site was borrowed from [derekeder/csv-to-html-table](https://github.com/derekeder/csv-to-html-table).
